(scikirbypoke)\n[C] Semantic Corrections in Russian Translation. (Shellyoung)\n[C] PostBase Recipe. Now using Cobblestone instead of Cobblestone-Walls.\n[C] Manual Entries. Being more readable and adding some nice images aswell.\n[F] Collision for Mini-Arms won't cause trouble anymore.",
		"0.1.3": "Change of plan.\nWarning: Please backup your world!\n\n- Added -\n  Concrete and Leaded Concrete Post.\n  Ways to localize things.\n  Russian Localization. (Shellyoung)\n\n- Fixes -\n  Post directly above the Postbase thinking its also a postbase.\n  Possible typos.\n\n- Changes -\n  Removed old Rod items and Re-added them using Metadata.\n  Index-Page is now twice as indexy.\n\nI may have forgotten some things, been a while.\nUse up all the rods you crafted (if any) or destroy/recycle them befor updating. Because they'll be gone and replaced by the new ones!\nSorry for being so chaotic with this. I should've done this at the start.",
		"0.1.2": "- Changes -\n  Optimized BlockStates to only include things that actualy matter.\n\n- Fixes -\n  Arms always facing down after reloading world.\n\n\n- Important notice befor updating, please read! -\nThis update, provided i didnt mess up again, will be the last one with the items having each a different ID!\n\nAfter this the items will only use one ID instead. So whenever that update comes, either use up all the rods\nyou crafted or destroy/recycle them befor updating. Because they'll be gone! (And backup your world, just incase)\nAnd re-apear with another ID. (Using metadata this time)\n\nI'll update to it just befor i move over to 1.13 (Once IE has it's first release for that.)\n\nIf you read all this, thank you for your time. I hereby release you from this mess. :D",

So far every fence uses it's own Block ID, same with Rods which is a waste of space.\nAnd to keep you guys from going insane with the updates, i'll leave it like this for now. Until then have fun!",
		"0.1.0": "This is a rather big one, with lots of new stuff being added.\nI highly recommend making a backup of your world befor loading it with this update!\n\n- Additions -\n10 new posts and matching fences (and rods to craft said fences) to use for extending.

Yes, im not sure by how much.\n  But i definitely noticed less lag when placing blocks near posts. (I have a potato, so i notice that stuff fairly easily)",
		"0.0.4-01": "- Additions -\nIE Manual Entry\n\n- Changes -\nGeneraly optimizing a few things here and there.\n\n- Fixes -\nTooltip now displays correctly.\nMini-Arms now don't apear anymore when a multiblock structure from IE is next to it.\nMissing texture on the bottom side of the top post cap.\nCreative Tab now has the correct name.",
