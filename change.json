		"0.0.5": "- Changes -\nPost \"mini-arms\" now behave like the ones from IE.\n  As you'd expect them to.\nBeing a perfectionist with textures.\n  Aka got rid of what apeared to be Stretching when looking at the top-most blocks.\nSome more opimization, mostly with the way \"connections\" are checked for the arms.\n  It's now X amount of times faster. Yes, im not sure by how much.\n  But i definitely noticed less lag when placing blocks near posts. (I have a potato, so i notice that stuff fairly easily)",
		"0.0.4-01": "- Additions -\nIE Manual Entry\n\n- Changes -\nGeneraly optimizing a few things here and there.\n\n- Fixes -\nTooltip now displays correctly.\nMini-Arms now don't apear anymore when a multiblock structure from IE is next to it.\nMissing texture on the bottom side of the top post cap.\nCreative Tab now has the correct name.",
		"0.0.4": "Finaly added these mini-arm that apear on the posts themself. (When you attach for example a lever to them)\n\nSo now it's (technicaly) feature-complete.",
		"0.0.3": "- Changes -\nMade arms less.. fiddly. (I hope)\n\n- Fixes -\nItem model is finaly visible to the world!\n\nI know: Just for that?\nWhy?\nI planned to add something else too but it will take longer than i first thought.",
		"0.0.2": "- Additions -\nSetup update notification stuff. (Now whenever a new version is released you'll be notified in-game.)\nAdded recipe for the Extendable Post prematurely. (Mind that the item still doesnt display correctly!)\n\n- Changes -\nChanged versioning scheme to fit the update notfication stuff. (Starting with 0.0.2)\n\n- Fixes -\nRight-clicking an arm with a fence, and another arm being directly above it, won't spawn a post ontop of the second arm.\nRight-clicking an upside-down arm with a fence won't place a post above it.",
		"0.0.1.001": "- Fixes - \nArms now correctly display upside down when a block is below it.\nArms don't flip if a block is already above it.\nPost Top doesnt change to normal Post when an Arm is above it.\n\nNow requires ImmersiveEngineering 0.12 or Higher. (Instead of ImmersiveEngineering 0.12-8)",
