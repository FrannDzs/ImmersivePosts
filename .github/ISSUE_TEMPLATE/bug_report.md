## Minecraft and ImmersivePosts version *(Required)*
Be mindful that i dropped support for 1.12.2.
Any issues with that are going to the void.

## What happend? *(Required)*
I did *this thing* and *that thing* then *it happend*.

## Crash Log *(Required)*
Force crash minecraft by holding F3+C for a while.
Put it up on [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) or use [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) (preferred), this will make things easier for me.

## Screenshot(s) *(Optional)(Removeable)*
Images say more than a thousand words, so if you are bad at explaining things like me, throw in some images to accompany the `What happend?` section above.
(Perhaps you could even reference them in that section too)

## Additional context *(Optional)(Removeable)*
Add any other context about the problem here.
